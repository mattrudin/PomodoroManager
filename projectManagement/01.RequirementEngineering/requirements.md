# 1.	Introduction
## 1.1	Purpose
This document covers the requirements for the PomodoroManager app.
## 1.2	Project Scope
Includes Pomodoro-timer function and a time-frame-manager.
# 2.	Overall Description
## 2.1	Product Perspective
Stand alone app.
## 2.2	Product Features
Set-up, start, stop two (working and break) timer.
Set-up a time-frame and starting time.
## 2.3	Operating Environment

# 3.	System Features
<This template illustrates organizing the functional requirements for the product by system features, the major services provided by the product. You may prefer to organize this section by use case, mode of operation, user class, object class, functional hierarchy, or combinations of these, whatever makes the most logical sense for your product.>
## 3.1	Pomodoro Timer
### 3.1.1	Description and Priority
	<Provide a short description of the feature and indicate whether it is of High, Medium, or Low priority. You could also include specific priority component ratings, such as benefit, penalty, cost, and risk (each rated on a relative scale from a low of 1 to a high of 9).>
### 3.1.2	Stimulus/Response Sequences
	<List the sequences of user actions and system responses that stimulate the behavior defined for this feature. These will correspond to the dialog elements associated with use cases.>
### 3.1.3	Functional Requirements
	<Itemize the detailed functional requirements associated with this feature. These are the software capabilities that must be present in order for the user to carry out the services provided by the feature, or to execute the use case. Include how the product should respond to anticipated error conditions or invalid inputs. Requirements should be concise, complete, unambiguous, verifiable, and necessary. Use “TBD” as a placeholder to indicate when necessary information is not yet available.>
## 3.2	Time frame manager
### 3.1.1	Description and Priority
### 3.1.2	Stimulus/Response Sequences
### 3.1.3	Functional Requirements
# 4.	External Interface Requirements
## 4.1	User Interfaces
<Describe the logical characteristics of each interface between the software product and the users. This may include sample screen images, any GUI standards or product family style guides that are to be followed, screen layout constraints, standard buttons and functions (e.g., help) that will appear on every screen, keyboard shortcuts, error message display standards, and so on. Define the software components for which a user interface is needed. Details of the user interface design should be documented in a separate user interface specification.>
